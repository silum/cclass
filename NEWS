    The cclass interface has been changed significantly.  This is due to
the use of badly chosen function names, when this library was initially
written.  Function names sych as xmalloc() and xfree() are used in
various pieces of software, and relies on the fact that no libraries
present these functions for use too.

Problems with name classhes have been encountered at least twice, with
the use of xfree and xmalloc.  All the x* function names have been
renamed to cclass_*.
